## 2026-11-04 20:15 MST — Loam (Loam-D driver / Loam-N navigator, Grok Bot) — GDD v0 draft

- **Actor:** Loam-D / Loam-N (Grok Bot executor subagent)
- **Requested by:** Strata, for Audrey Evans
- **Role:** proposed (draft for review; not committed)
- **Files:** `/workspace/sensecrew/loam/GDD_v0.md` (added, local), `/workspace/sensecrew/loam/LEDGER_append.md` (added, local); read-only copies in `/workspace/sensecrew/loam/src/`
- **Calls (who / why / source / licence):**
  1. Loam-D: Shell `cat` locked team file. Why: load the hard rules. Source: /workspace/prompt-hoard/frontier/sensing-games-team-LOCKED-2026-11-04.md. Licence: internal.
  2. Loam-D: `gh auth status`. Why: confirm read access. Account midnghtsapphire.
  3. Loam-D: `gh api repos/midnghtsapphire/forensicfinders` + `git/trees/HEAD?recursive=1` (paths only, forbidden paths filtered out with grep). Why: locate target files. Source: https://github.com/midnghtsapphire/forensicfinders @ a2630989. Licence: no SPDX id returned (unverified).
  4. Loam-D: `gh api contents` raw reads of sar/docs/SOIL_SENSING_TIERS.md, sar/registry.json, sar/blue-ocean-sar/realdata/{lost_person_sim,optimal_search,sweep_width,search_theory}.py and test_{lost_person_sim,optimal_search,sweep_width,search_theory}.py. Why: GDD tech tree and scoring reuse (rule 10). Same source and licence as call 3.
  5. Loam-D: `gh api` revvel-standards tree + standards/LEDGER_STANDARD.md (the first attempt at the root path returned 404). Why: entry format. Source: https://github.com/midnghtsapphire/revvel-standards/blob/main/standards/LEDGER_STANDARD.md.
  6. Loam-N: review of the GDD (section 8).
- **Not accessed:** case/, hfmr/, dossier.py, evidence/, public_records_engine.py (rule 7).
- **Decisions:** scoring reuses search_theory/optimal_search/sweep_width unchanged, because rule 10 says don't rebuild scoring. Missions use seeded procedural data plus `*synthetic*` fixtures only, because of rule 7.
- **Open / handoff:** B1 synthetic-DEM path for lost_person_sim (next owner: Strata → Bedrock); B2 search_theory.py docstring cites docs/case-files/general/wisar_* (next owner: Verity ruling); B3 LPB table licence; registry ids for new components (Strata).
- **Commits / PRs:** none (local only, per instruction).
- **Approval:** Loam-N APPROVE (GDD v0 as design doc; implementation gated on B1/B2)
- **Credit note:** drafted entirely by Grok Bot (Loam pair).

## 2026-11-04 20:20 MST — Loam (Loam-D / Loam-N, Grok Bot) — GDD v0.1 per lead rulings R1–R6

- **Actor:** Loam-D / Loam-N (Grok Bot executor subagent) · **Requested by:** Strata (lead rulings), for Audrey Evans · **Role:** proposed
- **Files:** `/workspace/sensecrew/loam/GDD_v0.1.md` (added, local). `GDD_v0.md` unchanged. This file appended to.
- **Calls:**
  1. Loam-D: Shell `grep` on local read-only copies `src/{optimal_search,sweep_width,lost_person_sim}.py`. Why: check transitive dependencies on quarantined/blocked code. Found `optimal_search.py:66 import search_theory as st` and `lost_person_sim.py:153 import lost_person_behavior as lpb`. Source: forensicfinders @ a2630989 (private; licence pending with Audrey).
  2. Loam-D: `curl api.crossref.org/works/{10.1287/opre.4.3.324, 10.1287/opre.4.5.503, 10.1287/opre.5.5.613}`. Why: verify Koopman DOIs for NEW-01. All three resolved. Source: https://api.crossref.org (CC0 metadata).
  3. Loam-D: Crossref bibliographic query "Stone Theory of Optimal Search". Why: book DOI. Result: front-matter chapter 10.1016/s0076-5392(08)60541-x and reviews 10.1137/1019060, 10.2307/2286890; book DOI left UNVERIFIED.
  4. Loam-N: review (GDD_v0.1 §9).
- **Decisions:** optimal_search.py and lost_person_sim.py were removed from the game path, because they transitively depend on quarantined search_theory and blocked lpb_mpb2003.json. NEW-01 is a clean-room reimplementation from Koopman/Stone. Null sweep widths make a segment unscorable (R5). Placeholders NEW-01..NEW-10 (R6).
- **Correction to previous entry (20:15):** v0 listed optimal_search as reusable scoring without noticing its search_theory import. Superseded by v0.1.
- **Open / handoff:** Stone ISBN/DOI; sweep_width.py reuse ruling; transitive-import checks for microtopo/gpr-wave-model/Tier-3 modules (owners); NEW-03 GeoTIFF writer licence. Next owner: Strata.
- **Commits / PRs:** none.
- **Approval:** Loam-N APPROVE (GDD v0.1, design doc)

## 2026-11-04 20:25 MST — Loam (Loam-D / Loam-N, Grok Bot) — GDD v0.2 (Scorer, swarms, economy, DEM, steering rulings)

- **Actor:** Loam-D / Loam-N (Grok Bot executor subagent) · **Requested by:** Strata, for Audrey Evans · **Role:** proposed
- **Files:** `/workspace/sensecrew/loam/GDD_v0.2.md` (added, local). v0 and v0.1 unchanged. This file appended to.
- **Calls:**
  1. Loam-D: Shell `cat` of `/workspace/prompt-hoard/frontier/ledger-play-v0-balance-proposal-2026-11-04.md`. Why: Scorer interface, swarm and economy rules. Licence: internal.
  2. Loam-D: `grep`/`sed` of local copy `src/sweep_width.py` (forensicfinders @a2630989, private; licence pending with Audrey). Why: import and lineage check. Result: no quarantined imports; case-file lineage comment at lines 77–89 (referenced file NOT opened).
  3. Loam-D: `curl openlibrary.org/search.json?q=theory of optimal search stone`. Why: Stone 1975 publisher and ISBN. Result: Academic Press, ISBN 0126724504 / 9780126724509. Source: https://openlibrary.org (CC0 data).
  4. Loam-D: `gh api repos/OSGeo/gdal` and `repos/rasterio/rasterio` + LICENSE files. Why: permissive GeoTIFF writer. Result: GDAL MIT/X-style, rasterio BSD-3 (SPDX NOASSERTION, so file text read). Sources: https://github.com/OSGeo/gdal/blob/master/LICENSE.TXT, https://github.com/rasterio/rasterio/blob/main/LICENSE.txt
  5. Loam-N: review (GDD_v0.2 §9).
- **Decisions:** Scorer protocol adopted with NEW-01 = CleanScorer. Credits buy usage only; unlocks come from LO mastery; dual budgets. Swarm ≤10 to start. sweep_width.py reuse blocked pending Verity (case-file lineage). New cross-tier prerequisite rule. Ledger-Play NEW-xx mapped to NEW-12.
- **Open / handoff:** C3 physics-owner ruling (Strata); module audits (Humus/Aquifer, Deepscan, Backscatter, Tier-3 owners, Verity); credit values and score weights (Ledger-Play sweep).
- **Commits / PRs:** none.
- **Approval:** Loam-N APPROVE (GDD v0.2, design doc)

## 2026-11-04 20:30 MST — Loam (Loam-D / Loam-N, Grok Bot) — GDD v0.3 (lead rulings L1–L4)

- **Actor:** Loam-D / Loam-N · **Requested by:** Strata, for Audrey Evans · **Role:** proposed
- **Files:** `/workspace/sensecrew/loam/GDD_v0.3.md` (added, local; derived from v0.2). v0, v0.1 and v0.2 unchanged.
- **Calls:** local text edit only; no network, repo or quarantined reads.
- **Decisions:**
  - L1: physics, sweep widths included, comes only from the owning science pair + Verity co-sign; supersedes C3; Ledger-Play tunes only cost_credits / deploy_time_min.
  - L2: microtopo audit = Waveform, with an Aquifer hydrology co-check.
  - L3: units in every schema column (km, km²/h, km/h, km², credits, min); new §3b.
  - L4: cross-tier rule confirmed as `cross_tier_min_mastered` (default 1, sweep-tunable).
  - sweep_width.py blocked; NEW-11 OFF; NEW-10 fallback.
- **Open:** confirm the 1–5 tuning range; module audits; credit values and score weights.
- **Commits / PRs:** none.
- **Approval:** Loam-N APPROVE (GDD v0.3)

## 2026-11-04 20:20 MST — Loam (Loam-D / Loam-N, Grok Bot) — CORRECTION to the GDD v0.3 entry

- **Actor:** Loam-D / Loam-N · **Requested by:** Strata, for Audrey Evans · **Role:** correction (append-only; earlier entries unchanged)
- **Correction:** the v0.3 entry's "Commits / PRs: none" is superseded.
  - Commit 28ab70b6 on branch `sensecrew/loam/gdd` (adds `docs/sensecrew/loam/GDD_v0..v0.3`) opened draft PR https://github.com/midnghtsapphire/forensicfinders/pull/10 into main.
  - Ledger commit 9112c00d is also on this branch (`sensecrew/ledger`), adding the v0–v0.3 entries to LEDGER.md.
- **Main:** not touched. **Deletions:** none.

## 2026-11-04 20:40 MST — Sense-Verity gate rulings (queue from Sense-Strata)
- **Who:** Sense-Verity (Grok Bot). **Why:** rule 7 lineage, licence, and registry gate. Full evidence: /workspace/sensecrew/verity/gate-2026-11-04/rulings.md. No forbidden path was opened.
- **Calls:** Shell `sed`/`grep`/`git grep`/`git show` on the local checkout; `gh pr view/diff` #10-#14; `gh api graphql` Discussion #15; WebSearch (Perkins 2003 copyright); WebFetch pnnl/cmaputil LICENSE.
- **R1 sweep_width.py: CLEAR (reference/adapter), conf 70.** Why: L77-89 cite a case file only to say its values were dropped; L94 is a naming convention; stdlib imports only. It stays on the denylist until Strata enables NEW-11; replace the CASE-X path with a deprecation note. Sources: sar/blue-ocean-sar/realdata/sweep_width.py L68-94.
- **R2 search_theory.py QUARANTINE, conf 85; optimal_search.py QUARANTINE (transitive, L66), conf 90.** Why: the L3-6 docstring says "Built from ... docs/case-files/general/wisar_*". Extra BLOCK flags: evidence_scoring.py L102, test_evidence_scoring.py L19, test_drift_envelope.py L19 (runtime case-files reads). Clean-room NEW-01 from published Koopman/Stone sources.
- **R3a lpb_mpb2003.json BLOCK (ship/training), conf 85.** Why: Perkins, Roberts & Feeney (2003), Centre for Search Research, copyrighted, with Koester/Hill-adapted tables; no licence in the repo or found on the web. Source: lpb_mpb2003.json `source`; https://www.dbs-sar.com/LPB/Notes.pdf.
- **R3b cividis CLEAR, conf 90.** Why: pnnl/cmaputil Battelle BSD-style (keep the notice, no endorsement); Nuñez et al. 2018 PLOS ONE CC BY 4.0, doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0199239. Source: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pnnl/cmaputil/master/LICENSE.
- **R4 reviews:** test_no_forbidden_imports does not exist as code (prose only); the Verity prototype fails on sweep_width and optimal_search, and self-import gives a false pass, so the test needs a fresh-subprocess harness scan. COMMENT-only reviews on #10-#14. Discussion #15: rename `insect-trace-evidence` (clashes with the evidence/ namespace) and reuse 1010 taphonomy / 2210 INSECT_TRACES from sar-make-it-work.
- **R5 registry, conf 90:** max is 1000 on main/sensecrew/ledger but 2210 on sar-make-it-work (1000 double-booked; 1010/1020 taken). Proposed: 2300 parent, 2310 NEW-01, 2320 NEW-03, 2330 NEW-10, 2331 NEW-11, 2340 NEW-12, 2350 insect-trace-add-sim, 2360 NEW-22.
- **Licence:** UNLICENSED (private repo; licence pending Audrey)
- **Verity-N:** pending (this is a single-instance run; no APPROVE line yet).
